## Project Overview  
The **College Alumni Connect & Management System** is a web-based platform designed to bridge the communication gap between alumni and the institution.  
It provides a centralized system for managing alumni data, mentorship, events, career guidance, and feedback collection.

This platform strengthens alumni–college engagement and helps current students receive support, guidance, and opportunities from former graduates.

---

## Objectives  
- Develop a centralized digital platform for seamless communication between alumni, students, faculty, and administrators.  
- Maintain an organized alumni database with features like mentorship, event updates, and verified feedback.  
- Enable structured interaction through career guidance, networking tools, and real-time updates.

##  Problem Statement  
Most colleges face:  
- No unified platform for students, alumni, faculty & admin communication  
- Unorganized alumni data  
- Lack of real-time communication tools  
- No automated feedback collection & verification  
- No AI-based mentor matching system  

This leads to poor engagement and missed career opportunities.
